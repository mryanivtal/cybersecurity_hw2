35131,35131,"The city hung under a pall of grey, the roiling mass of cloud above and distant thunder promising a storm.  The streets were empty, with the exception of the few huddled figures going about their late-afternoon business.   From the hills to the east, the all-encompassing fog began to descend, making its way through the latticework of streets, tendrils of mist inquisitively groping at the forms of buildings and unlit street lamps.  The insistent wind pulls the fog towards the outskirts of the city, to a hill upon which a lone building stands, its stalwart and foreboding form the last bastion of civilization before the dark and untamed woods beyond.  From within this ancient, decrepit building can be heard the fevered sounds of the delirious, their unintelligible cacophonies echoing down the long, poorly lit halls.  At the end of one such hallway is a shadowed room, one of the numberless cells in this house of the insane.  Within, a frail figure lies in the corner of the room, curled upon the mold-infested floor.  The figure is that of an aged man, eyes bright with the intensity of madness, his long, unkempt beard and hair framing a face that had been hallowed by untold suffering.  Rocking back and forth in the darkness, the ancient man utters wordless litanies of hysteria, lost within his own twisted thoughts.  Each waking moment, every breath he takes brings unspeakable torment, for he is haunted by the self-created demons lurking in the lurid depths of his mind, a mind long without any vestiges of sanity.  He longs for the sweet release of sleep, but knows that he must suffer until the night, when he is administered his medication.  Until then, he waits, sequestered in the dark recesses of his mind, tortured by the misshapen, grotesquely howling denizens of his imagination.  Outside, rivulets of rainwater course languidly down the dirty glass of the window, framed by the sporadic flicker of lightning and shaken by the deep reverberations of thunder.  At last, its malevolent energy exhausted, the raging storm abates, and the clouds disperse, returning to their homes beyond the horizon, revealing the ivory crescent of the pure moon and the illimitable canvas of stars and distant galaxies beyond.  Within the asylum, a white-clad figure approaches the heavy door at the end of the hall, metal tray in hand.  Inside the cell, upon the moon-lit floor, the ancient man crawls towards the dark door.  With a rusty creaking, the door swings open, bathing the room in a dim glow.  The figure in white sets down the tray and eases the heavy door shut, securing the bolt on the other side.  Upon the tray rests a small porcelain cup, filled with a garish amber substance.  Trembling, the old man reaches for the crucible and the medicine within, the glowing golden elixir which would set him free.  Downing the mixture, the aged man coughs and hacks, almost choking, before catching his breath.  Ecstatic, the man begins to feel the effects of the elixir, the numbing, blissfully painless tranquility coursing throughout his body.  At last, he slips into unconsciousness, the silence of deep slumber enveloping him and his tortured visions utterly.
 

He wandered alone in the vast expanse of his mind, of the demons there was no sign.  He began his journey across the black wastelands of his dream, crossing through the horrendous valley of despair, luckily uninhabited by the demons of his waking nightmares, and at last arriving at the rolling plains of memory.  The crescent moon hangs over the foothills, basking the plains in a surreal glow.  The familiar sight of a small, homely cottage greeted the man as he strode across the silent fields of his ancient memories.  Opening the stained wooden door, he stepped inside.    The cottage was one-roomed, just as he had remembered it from his childhood long ago.  In the center was a small table, and two hand-carved wooden chairs neatly tucked under it.  He ignored the undisturbed furniture and turned to the far wall of the room.  Dominating this wall was large, intricately gilded mirror, fantastic images of long-forgotten tales and magnificent vistas adorning its golden frame.  Gazing into the shifting surface of the mirror, the old man beheld his ragged and time-worn body.  Touching the surface of the mirror, he felt energy begin to pour into him, racing from his fingertips into his arm and into his body.  Light poured forth from his aged form, and he felt his frail form being unmade.  At last, the transformation was complete, and he saw in the mirror opposite a figure, not the old and weakened man, but a remnant of past times, a healthy, vibrant young man, untouched by madness and the inexorable passage of time.  Smiling, he stepped outside, and regarded the night sky above him, stars dancing in ever-shifting patterns around the pale moon.  Closing his eyes, he began to rise into the air, currents of dream-wind carrying him upwards, towards the constellations.  He flew past the moon, past the winking lights of the dancing stars, until at last behind him, the dark hemisphere of his dream-world had disappeared completely.  Finally he broke through the obscuring mist of space and out into the night above the city, wings of crystalline filaments carrying him onwards.  He whirled above the sleeping city, letting himself be tossed about by the dream-energy of the thousands slumbering beneath him.  Reaching into his pocket, he drew forth a silver compass.  Eyeing the needle, he dived towards the city, racing past the rows of street lamps lining the empty streets.  At last he saw his destination, a small, shining golden dream-cloud suspended outside the window of a small apartment.  Upon the front of the cloud was a nondescript wooden door, and he reached for the silver knob.  The door was locked, and the man reached into his pocket and produced a magnificent silver key.  Sliding the key into the worn lock, he felt the tumblers fall away one by one.  The door opened before him, and he stepped through.  He found himself in a dark wood, the rotting trees interlaced with a creeping mist.  The air was stagnant, and the smell of sulphur was almost nauseating.  Suddenly, in the distance, a shrill scream pierced the stillness of the night.  He ran towards the sound, racing past fallen trees and decaying fauna.  He at last reached the source of the cry, a young boy cowering in a clearing.  He moved to console the distraught child, but from the woods leapt a massive beast, covered in long oily fur, its glowing, coal-like eyes burning in the darkness of the foreboding forest.  It strode forward, its maw glowing with row upon row of brilliantly sharp fangs, its massive paws adorned with wicked claws.  .  The beast faced the man, breath steaming with boundless hunger.  With a thought, the man created about himself a suit of golden armour, blindingly radiant in contrast to the sublime blackness of the beast.  Reaching once again into his pocket, the man withdrew his shining Vorpal blade, which grew into a great longsword, and turned to face the beast.  Its claws raked out in a wide arc, nearly catching the man, but he turned the blade up to block the great paws.  Vibrant sparks flew as the nightmarish claws of the monster clashed with the blade forged in the fires of pure imagination, both combatants expertly blocking and swiftly lashing out at the other, hoping to find an opening in the other’s defence.  At last the man saw his opportunity, and with a mighty thrust took the beast through the heart.  Roaring in agony, the great beast burst into flames, acrid smoke pouring forth from its eyes and mouth.  Soon, nothing was left of it except for a pile of smouldering ash and the fading echoes of its death throes.  Turning to the young boy, who gazed in amazement at this shining paladin, the man removed his crested golden helm and presented it to the child.  The boy eagerly accepted, and then ran off into the woods, now lush with greenery and lit by the warm glow of an evening sun.  The man felt the dream unravelling about him and cut himself loose from the strand tying him to the vision of the child, and found himself once more floating above the sleeping

I want to be able to return a book, and then list all the other books that person currently has out.  Like I said, I could prompt for the patron id, but I'd rather the script did it without.  Is there a way to find the patronid who has this particular bookid, and then search f or all other book ids borrowed by that patron id? I think the last quote goes after the ; followed by the database name if this is a bash command. Can't help you then.  Sorry.  That's how it owuld go in bash though, perhaps they're similar. I think so.  I don't have to put ' around the column names though, only the values. sounds violent. Back to my quesiton... I tried to make a variable without user input patid=mysql --execute=&quot;select patid as * from titlesout where bookid = '$bookid';&quot; library The ' ' gives me a blank column name and the the patid.  Later in the script a query runs with the patid inserted to find out all the other books they have, but the blank clumn name is part of the variable and things don't work. tempered, join me in #craig for a minute Can you explain that a bit further?

My top gear is bit under the normal a Divinew adlut’s average, and a lot below and the special’s. Then men start shooting me, but I manage to dodge. I am near the ship, but I fear it might of left. I push my legs harder, but that won’t help me, I will die, right here, right know. I turn to see a sword fly towards me, and it cuts threw my waist. I fall, and roll about 8 times. If it weren’t by my superhuman powers, I’d be dead. I rip the sword from my body, throw it at them, and run after the sword, the blade being a mere distraction, for I won’t go down without a good fight. As I near, pain spreads over me, then rage. I hold my waist, trying to keep my insides in my body. I spread towards them, in a rampage of kicks and fists. I am shot in the back by 3 shotguns at the same time, as I fall to my knees, struggling to breathe, I see a man come towards me. “You’re supposed to be on my side. You’d throw your friends, family, everything, just for this!!” I say tears threating to appear. A smirk forms on his evil face, and I meditate on how I didn’t realize how evil he was before. “Winning side, Tom. Don’t take it too personal,” he says. “   You traitor!” is the only thing I manage to murmur. “Pour oil on him” he says to 2 guards, and they do as instructed. “I’ll apologize in hell, old friend” he says, and I say “Can’t be there, I’ve kind ‘a  have and appointment in heaven”. He lights a cigar and smokes. “Fair enough, he says, an then a tosses the cigar on me. I immediately burn and I hope my family is safe.

I receive Strings containing 005:30;007:20;  ... that is memaddr:value, so I want to look up memaddr quickly and store value. Therefore a map with memaddr as key.  Later for sending I want to be able to look up the name quickly to get the memaddr, therefore maybe a stl multi indexed map or even a second map with pointer.. :) Later I add also atrributes like min, max value.. I'm also not sure about handling memaddress (being hex) as QString or transforming into int maybe. ahigerd: the sendToServer() will check if that's allowd. ahigerd: Ok, but I won't do calculation on it, and QString is also countable. It's just for receiveing, sending and storing. ahigerd: ok, doesn't matter for now. I don't like that #define construct, and the 1000 lines.  I got the memory layout as layout.txt, and maybe could generate the code with something like awk.. Yeah, using that layout in the pastebin, it's possible. But that will become a really large CTor for initialization. ahigerd, as for the data structure, you don't have a better idea? I just have seen boost multi_index map <a href=""http://www.boost.org/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial.html"">http://www.boost.org/libs/multi_index/doc/tutorial.html</a>  and that looks really complicated to me, a bit too much:) ahigerd: If I get into awk, the text file should be readable.  But then my own layout should be for sure. ahigerd: I will look into QMultiMap, if that's easier to set up. so you have time now .. ahigerd: The txt file looks like that: <a href=""http://rafb.net/paste/results/FfFJdD79.html"">http://rafb.net/paste/results/FfFJdD79.html</a> ahigerd: On Qt 3.3 I found qmap.h which is just the implementation of the STL like. Can't find MultiMap :)yes. MultiMap being one of the vers.4 changes/improvements? mETz: But multimap isn't exactly what I need, I would need a double indexed map. ahigerd: That's really good.   QMap&lt;QString, int&gt; addresses;  will take the adress as first, but what about that int? ahigerd: whitespaces are stripped, but not the &quot;.&quot; points? ahigerd: Oh I see, it doesn't use the text file, but finally it could be able to parse the textfile twice to build up 2 indipendent QMaps? ahigerd: Thanks, would have taken me longer time than you:)",0.0,423,"['maybe', 'pure', 'implement', 'controller', 'protocol', 'have', 'memory', 'layout', 'decide', 'take', 'map', 'mem', 'adress', 'map', 'key', 'data', 'property', 'layout', 'look', 'kind', 'of', 'bad', 'happy', 'help', 'raft', 'net', 'paste', 'result', 'help', 'raft', 'net', 'paste', 'result', 'sorry', 'happy', 'will', 'take', 'look', 'variant', 'set', 'top', 'communication', 'controller', 'socket', 'receive', 'string', 'contain', 'memaddr', 'value', 'so', 'want', 'look', 'memaddr', 'quickly', 'store', 'value', 'therefore', 'map', 'memaddr', 'key', 'later', 'send', 'want', 'able', 'look', 'name', 'quickly', 'memaddr', 'therefore', 'maybe', 'multi', 'indexed', 'map', 'even', 'second', 'map', 'pointer', 'later', 'add', 'also', 'attribute', 'value', 'also', 'sure', 'handle', 'hex', 'string', 'transform', 'int', 'maybe', 'shigeru', 'sendtoserver', 'will', 'check', 'allow', 'win', 'calculation', 'string', 'also', 'countable', 'just', 'receive', 'send', 'store', 'ok', 'doesn', 'matter', 'now', 'don', 'like', 'define', 'construct', 'line', 'get', 'memory', 'layout', 'layout', 'text', 'maybe', 'could', 'generate', 'code', 'use', 'layout', 'pastebin', 'i', 'possible', 'will', 'become', 'really', 'large', 'actor', 'initialization', 'shigeru', 'data', 'structure', 'well', 'idea', 'just', 'see', 'boost', 'multi', 'index', 'map', 'ref', 'help', 'boost', 'tutorial', 'himl', 'help', 'boost', 'tutorial', 'himl', 'look', 'really', 'complicated', 'bit', 'too', 'much', 'shigeru', 'get', 'awk', 'text', 'file', 'should', 'readable', 'then', 'own', 'layout', 'should', 'sure', 'will', 'look', 'easy', 'set', 'so', 'time', 'now', 'shigeru', 'text', 'file', 'look', 'help', 'raft', 'net', 'paste', 'result', 'help', 'raft', 'net', 'paste', 'result', 'find', 'map', 'just', 'implementation', 'can', 'find', 'ver', 'change', 'improvement', 'exactly', 'need', 'would', 'need', 'double', 'indexed', 'map', 'shigeru', 'really', 'good', 'map', 'stre', 'address', 'will', 'take', 'adress', 'as', 'first', 'int', 'shigeru', 'whitespace', 'strip', 'quit', 'quit', 'point', 'see', 'use', 'text', 'file', 'finally', 'could', 'able', 'parse', 'textile', 'twice', 'build', 'independent', 'map', 'thank', 'would', 'take', 'long', 'time']"

If that's the case... Gimme a sec. :P paoleela_work: How important is the read-only flag to you? I'd transform to int, it's faster Fair enough; you can use QString if you like. Oh! If you've got a text file this gets really easy. ;) What's the layout of the text file? QMultiHash/QMultiMap -- Qt has them too But anyway Hold on a bit There's no need for awk; what does the text file look like? Hmm, I see.

(in Chrome 15 dev) In Firefox 8.0a2, it drops it from around 78s to 45s. jgraham, while I agree that in general it's better to use textContent instead of doing escaping manually, it's justifiable to use less-safe techniques in cases where they provide a large enough performance increase. FWIW, if I comment out your test suite and do function test(f) {try{f()}catch(e){}} and define assert_* as no-ops, it takes like one second to run the tests. So the time it's taking is basically all the test suite, not the tests. jgraham, diff: http://pastebin.com/wbAazWRk jgraham, additional proposed change: hide results by default if there are &gt; 1000 rows.  This reduces my real-world test-case to about 7 seconds in Chrome from 25 or so, from starting to load it until the page is usable. http://pastebin.com/YKdPRTem Of course, checking either of the boxes will freeze the tab for ten seconds or more. jgraham, I pushed another performance change that should hopefully be unobjectionable.  I'll wait for your feedback before pushing the other two. 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, running 26,000ish tests in jgraham's test harness.  I don't think it has anything to do with the tests themselves, it's all test harness overhead AFAICT. goes to dig up a stable URL for an example The exact URLs I'm using are works-in-progress, not useful for me to hand them out to anyone. 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, e.g., this takes over twice as long for me in Firefox as Chrome (will freeze Firefox briefly): http://dvcs.w3.org/hg/editing/raw-file/98671dcd5b1f/selecttest/Selection-collapse.html In that case it's less drastic, since it's only 4-5s in Chrome to start with, 9-10s in Firefox. Beware, the version of testharness.js included with that will change.  I'm in the middle of optimizing it. So if you want to profile properly, I suggest saving the page and all includes. ? 6b57ea7f33069df5914663ba9e59afdf, I've discovered my CPUs are older and cheaper than most people around here.  :) Freezes for more like 10 seconds for me. Well over a minute for longer test-cases. What CPU does it have? Anyway, obviously, Chrome doesn't freeze at all, except that one tab.  One of the biggest reasons I use Chrome right now. I'm using a 2.6 GHz AMD 64 X2.  So it's unsurprising that a Core 2 Duo is faster even at a slower clock speed, but a factor of two seems excessive. Oh well. What's Shark?

36647,36647,"eb4fd75d7c504913a3dfa2895fbaeb18: I have a mahjong score tracking page that is currently PHP based. Per round of play, scores are submitted, the scores are computed, and a new page is generated with which turn you're in, the scores so far, etc. this lets you save the page when you decide to take a break, and resume the same game whenever you feel like it, but saving the page and then reopening it later. I'm considering turning it into a JS-only solution, but then saving the page to resume a game later becomes rather problematic, because it'll save the initial page, not the current state. s/but/by it's not the game. it's just the scoring. you play the game on a table top (shock horror! O_O) but the scoring is complicated, and a web page that tracks it is far easier than pen and paper. if someone wins a hand, you fill in what everyone has, then hit &quot;score&quot; and all the values are sent to the backend, the resulting who-pays-what-to-whom algorithm is run, and a new page is generated with fresh player sheets, and a new line in the &quot;scores so far&quot; list. (and a button that lets you examine why everyone got the score they got) doing that in javascript, rather than sending it to the backend, is fairly simple but doing it in such a way that you can just save the page, because it's getting late and you'll finish the game tomorrow, and then open it again the next day with the same state is hairy yeah but try sending data to the backend when you don't actually have internet access I'd like to move it all to just on-page js, while retaining the benefit of being able to resume the page with whatever browser you want to use. Encoding the history in the page is easy through DOM manipulation, but getting it saved seems impossible it's like browsers are suck in the era that &quot;page I see&quot; is equal to &quot;the source I loaded&quot; *Stuck currently? a reload just resubmits the data. that is hardly user friendly you ever play mahjong? &quot;it takes hours&quot; is not a joke. unless I'm playing with regular players, it's pretty common to end the evening not quite done, and just saving the page for resuming some next time. copy-pasting source code's not ideal.

I don't know, you're asking a question, I'm answering it, if you think that's a waste of time, something went wrong =) think of it this way: arguments are not HTML they are instructions to the server. which means that your server can do something with them, to generate content. that includes making sure that content that needs to further use them in links, has them right there. it's your responsibility. if you're using PHP or something to accept those arguments, then you get to write the code to inject them into the form that gets generates for that page. it's pretty simple that way you're missing the point. where do params *GO* if you have plain html content, they don't go anywhere, argument parsing is not part of HTML, it's part of &quot;server-side handling&quot; so that's where you make the magic happen. and that's how new technology is born. c5c4e16354e3a5e00f5dfc21328c2573, don't have an ipad (sadly =) but have you tried reducing to see if it does simply draw instructions like a plain canvas with some rect/paths? with some luck it'll turn out to be.",0.0,397,"['action', 'quit', 'quit', 'quit', 'mean', 'quit', 'location', 'quit', 'quit', 'quit', 'mean', 'quit', 'dir', 'quit', 'parameter', 'latter', 'want', 'preserve', 'parameter', 'add', 'form', 'use', 'quit', 'input', 'type', 'hide', 'name', 'monkey', 'value', 'banana', 'quit', 'could', 'write', 'automatically', 'base', 'window', 'location', 'argument', 'single', 'time', 'thing', 'call', 'quit', 'index', 'quit', 'then', 'relative', 'link', 'relative', 'page', 'page', 'arm', 'action', 'take', 'legal', 'url', 'quit', 'quit', 'quit', 'quit', 'legal', 'curl', 'dir', 'quit', 'quit', 'parent', 'dir', 'quit', 'why', 'action', 'quit', 'index', 'himl', 'action', 'index', 'himl', 'same', 'thing', 'a20e0580519fa0e9092d058a67627726', 'form', 'need', 'preserve', 'argument', 'simply', 'use', 'bit', 'extend', 'form', 'modify', 'action', 'form', 'action', 'quit', 'maru', 'quit', 'page', 'quit', 'index', 'asp', 'quit', 'will', 'call', 'index', 'asp', 'maru', 'instance', 'so', 'want', 'explicitly', 'encode', 'argument', 'way', 'also', 'fine', 'come', 'think', 'action', 'quit', 'may', 'even', 'work', 'never', 'try', 'when', 'want', 'break', 'default', 'model', 'how', 'work', 'recommendation', 'involve', 'write', 'quit', 'pretty', 'serious', 'exactly', 'so', 'break', 'well', 'write', 'say', 'go', 'index', 'there', 'relative', 'link', 'quit', 'test', 'himl', 'where', 'should', 'go', 'test', 'don', 'know', 're', 'ask', 'question', 'answer', 'think', 'waste', 'time', 'go', 'wrong', 'think', 'way', 'argument', 'himl', 'instruction', 'server', 'mean', 'server', 'can', 'generate', 'content', 'include', 'make', 'sure', 'content', 'need', 'further', 'use', 'link', 'right', 'there', 'responsibility', 're', 'use', 'pop', 'accept', 'argument', 'then', 'get', 'write', 'code', 'inject', 'form', 'get', 'generate', 'page', 'pretty', 'simple', 'way', 're', 'miss', 'point', 'where', 'param', 'go', 'plain', 'himl', 'content', 'don', 'go', 'anywhere', 'argument', 'parsing', 'part', 'part', 'server', 'side', 'handling', 'quit', 'where', 'make', 'magic', 'happen', 'how', 'new', 'technology', 'bear', 'ipad', 'sadly', 'try', 'reduce', 'see', 'simply', 'draw', 'instruction', 'plain', 'canvas', 'rect', 'path', 'luck', 'turn']"

I'm trying to cram a MicroATX into it right now, but it's not fitting very nicely. undrdawg: Nope. I don't have any really useful tools for testing. :\ It's not worth saving, anyway. I can probably find another one some day. I'll just junk it for a neat case. :P I've got new drill bits, after all. :D silverpower: Not really... I just need to drill some holes, put in some risers, mount it all up and use some extension cables to connect the back ports. o.O undrdawg: I have a continuity tester, but that's no good for complex circuits. Also, the VGA is onboard. :P Regarding the mod, the trick part will be making the power switch work. How do you go from a hard-flip on/off switch to a soft power button? tricky* Also, I have a new, important question: What purpose do the extra four pins on the additional plug with newer motherboards serve? Does it supply vital power or optional? Can a system with a light accelerated PCI video card and a large CPU fan survive without it? I can't fit a standard ATX PSU into the case along with my P4 MicroATX Foxconn board. They don't make oddly shaped new ones, and the only ATX PSU I have that fits obviously lacks the extra four-pin plug. It's a 300w out of an old Gateway... I don't know if it'd do the trick. I'm not used to it. Just looked it up. Apparently it's vital with P4 systems. Now I'm stuck. :P Mmm. I'm looking at a VERY cheap Flex ATX board on eBay. It has a Socket 370 Motherboard, and I happen to own a 1GHz Pentium III chip. It'll be about $25 with shipping. Hmm... What would three long beeps followed by three short beeps be? I dug up an old Slot 1 MicroATX board and stuck a PIII and a random stick of untested memory in it. Bad memory? :P It's fucking dead as a cemetary in here. Seems the beeping board didn't like my PIII. Either it can't handle it (odd for 1998), or the PIII is dead. Who knows. That plan's ruined, though. Wow.

37258,37258,"TabAtkins, maybe Values and Units should define an &lt;angle-or-zero&gt; type?  Or redefine &lt;angle&gt; to be &lt;angle-unit-required&gt; or zero, so specs that want to allow 0 can use &lt;angle&gt; and specs that don't have to use &lt;angle-unit-required&gt;? (or some better name) It seems like it makes the most sense for Values and Units to expose an easy way to do &quot;angle or zero&quot;, since most specs that use &lt;angle&gt; will want that. For that matter, why not define a new &lt;length-unit-required&gt; and redefine &lt;length&gt; in terms of that?  That requires a parser change, but it should be compatible with content, yes? Also, random remark: after I'm done with transforms/transitions/animations, I want to do CSSOM.  Lack of CSSOM interop has been a thorn in my side when writing JS for close to a year now.  Like: serialization. TabAtkins, I've noticed a few editorial bugs (typos etc.) in Values and Units.  It seems there's nowhere to file bugs, so I have to send mail to www-style? Ugh, why does the CSSWG use conference calls for technical discussion? wants to go back to DOM-land Which Glenn? And is he in CSS-land or DOM-land? I've seen him in HTML-land a bit. jamesr_, in my EC2 Windows Server VM, about:gpu claims hardware acceleration for everything, but CSS 3D stuff still seems not to work correctly. It looks like I could get a VM with a GPU if I wanted to pay $2.60/hour instead of $0.00/hour (free usage tier yay), but I don't know if Chrome would actually notice it, since I doubt it's configured for use with the actual display.

It prepends it to the second line instead of adding a new line before the current line. Same as if you did Shift+End instead of Shift+Down Arrow. And with RTL, arrows move in logical direction, not visual.  So the right arrow moves left and vice versa.  Which frankly might make some sense, but it's not what any other program in the universe does. If you're going to reinvent the wheel, is it too much to ask that you do it properly?

You'd know which phones are up-to-date now, but it would be bad for telling how long each one got support.
